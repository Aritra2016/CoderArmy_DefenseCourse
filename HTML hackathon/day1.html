     <h1>Day 1: What is HTML | Heading | Paragraph | Anchor tag | Image element </h1>

    <p> <b> What it is this--</b>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is the standard language used to create and structure the content of a webpage.

 <ul>
    <li> - HyperText: This refers to the ability to create links that connect web pages to one another, making the web a connected "web" of information. </li>

    <li> - Markup Language: This means you use "tags" to surround your content, giving that content meaning and structure. You are "marking up" a plain text document. </li>
 </ul>

    <h2>1. The Heading (h1 to h6) Tags </h2>
       <p> Headings are tags used to define titles and subtitles on your page. They are crucial for creating a logical hierarchy and outline for your content. </p>


- h1: The most important heading, typically used only once per page for the main title.
    <br>
- h2: A major section heading.
<br>
- h3: A sub-section heading under an h2.
<br>

<p>
   <b> The Purpose: </b> To structure your document in a way that is understandable to both humans and machines (like search engines and screen readers). It is not just for making text big; it is for giving the text structural importance.
</p>

  <h2>2. The Paragraph Tags  </h2>

    <p> The paragraph tag  is used to define a block of text as a paragraph. It helps in organizing text content into readable sections. Browsers automatically add some space (margin) before and after each paragraph to separate it from other elements. </p>

 <h2>3. HTML Horizontal Rules </h2>

 <p> The hr tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.
    <br>
The hr element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page: </p>

<h2> 4. The Line Break Tag </h2>
This tag tells the browser, "Stop writing on this line and immediately start on the next one." It's like hitting the Enter key once in a poem or an address.

<ul>
    <li><b> Purpose: </b> Creates a single line break. </li>
    <li><b>Example: </b> codeHtml </li>
</ul>

<h2>7: The Anchor Tag  </h2>

<p><b>What it is: </b> The Anchor tag is what makes the web "hypertext." It is used to create a hyperlink to another webpage, a file, or a location within the same page.</p>

<p><b>The Purpose:</b>  To make text (or an image) clickable, allowing users to navigate. It requires and attribute called href(hypertext reference) to specify the destination URL.</p>

<h2>HTML Links - The target Attribute</h2>

<p>By default, the linked page will be displayed in the current browser window. To change this, you must specify another target for the link.</p>

<p>The 'target'attribute specifies where to open the linked document.</p>


<p>The 'target' attribute can have one of the following values: </p>

<ul>
    <li>'_self' - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked</li>
    <li>'_blank'- Opens the document in a new window or tab </li>
</ul>
